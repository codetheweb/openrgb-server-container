# openrgb-server-container
ðŸŒˆ a container for running OpenRGB in headless mode

Want to control the lights on your (physical) server and you really don't need a GUI? This is the container for you.

**Note**: so far I've only tested this with USB devices. [Changes may be required](https://github.com/dcflachs/docker-containers/blob/master/openrgb/02-fix-attrs-i2c.sh) for I2C devices.
